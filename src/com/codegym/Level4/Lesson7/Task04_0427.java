/* Enter an integer from the keyboard in the range 1 - 999. Display a string description as follows:
"even single-digit number" - if the number is even and has one digit,
"odd single-digit number" - if the number is odd and has one digit,
"even two-digit number" - if the number is even and has two digits,
"odd two-digit number" - if the number is odd and has two digits,
"even three-digit number" - if the number is even and has three digits,
